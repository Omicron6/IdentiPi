# Midnight Private Smart Contract — Age Verification (ZK)

This folder contains the Midnight smart contract that verifies the
Zero-Knowledge proof generated by our Circom circuit for "Age ≥ 18".

## What this contract does
- Imports the Circom verification key 
- Validates Groth16 ZK Proofs inside Midnight's private execution layer
- Returns true or false without revealing the user's DOB or document
- Enables selective disclosure for decentralized identity

## Files:
- **AgeVerifier.mdsl**  
  The Midnight DSL smart contract used to verify proofs.
  
- **verifier_key.json**  
  Verification key generated from the Circom circuit.

## ZK Flow
1. User generates proof locally in the browser (fullProve()).
2. Proof and public signals are sent to this contract.
3. Contract calls groth16_verify() using the imported verification key.
4. If proof is valid → returns true (user is over 18).
5. No DOB or private data ever leaves the user's device.

## Why Midnight?
- Private on-chain verification  
- Zero-Knowledge based dApps  
- Perfect fit for identity selective disclosure  
- Ensures verifiers only learn the truth value, not personal data

## Status
This is the full verification logic.  
For the hackathon MVP, execution is simulated locally due to limited live deployment access.
