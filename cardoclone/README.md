IdentiPI-A decentralized, privacy-first identity wallet where users can prove
facts — not reveal documents.
To ensure trust, we’re introducing the first Identity CIBIL Score — a reliability
layer for digital identities, verified through Zero-Knowledge Proofs on Midnight.
• IdentiPI is a privacy-first decentralized identity system built on Cardano and Midnight,
designed to make identity verification as simple and trusted as UPI
• It empowers users to prove who they are without oversharing — using Decentralized
Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and Zero-Knowledge Proofs.
• The platform introduces the Identity CIBIL Score — a privacy-preserving reliability index
that detects mismatches across documents and rates the trustworthiness of a digital
identity based on which the KYC processes can be done.
